### First Evaluate whether or no the board is valid. 

I will make a fn that will make sure the input length is 27 and that each index length is 3. This function will return true or false.

### Evaluate each row and determine if it is valid

I will make a fn that will separate each row into single rows and determine that each includes the numbers 1-9

### Evaluate each square and determine if it is valid

I will make a fn that will separate each third index into a single element and determine that each element includes the numbers 1-9

### Evaluate each column and determine if it is valid

I will make a fn that will separate each index of every third index into a single element and determine that each element includes the numbers 1-9

### Evaluate that all previous elements have returned true
